## Classroom Wordle
This is a Wordle-style interactive classroom game developed with the intention to teach new vocabulary to students.

It allows the teacher to choose a word as the answer to the game and allows students to connect to the game through their game files on their own devices.
The game also makes use of a database to provide the teacher insights into stÄ±dents' performance while using the same data for scoring to encourage competition and boost motivation within the class
